The players will have a chance to log in through an input box
	their name will appear above which ever box they are apart of
	when a player types their name in it will need to be stored in an object

	an object that will also store the "choice" they made the "wins" and "loses"
	same thing with player 2

the player will need to click on either rock, paper, or scissors and have that value saved so that they can compare choices with each other

i will need to evalute who wins and who loses

	if player 1 wins, wins++ for him and loses++ for player 2, and vice versa

when either player types into the text box and hit enter or click send
	the input of what they put in the input box will appear in the message box
